# Emolga
Emolga is a discord bot based on the JDA library, which is mainly focused on pokémon.
The main feature is the automatic analysis of Pokémon Showdown! replays.
Examples are showing data of pokemon, moves, abilities etc. or leading drafts of draft leagues and many, many other features, for example kicking, warning and banning.
This is my first GitHub repository so when you have tips for me then tell me :D
